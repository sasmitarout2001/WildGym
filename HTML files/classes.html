          <h3>Zumba Classes</h3>
          <p>The high-energy classes are set to upbeat music and feature choreographed dance numbers that you might see in a nightclub. You don’t need to be a great dancer to feel welcome in a Zumba class. With the tag line, “Ditch the Workout, Join the Party,” the classes emphasize moving to the music and having a good time, no rhythm required.</p>

          <h3>Yoga Classes</h3>
          <p>This class is recommended for all levels and is a particularly good class for those with stress or anxiety, those in transition, or for those who just need a break from moving too quickly. This is also a great class for students who are recovering from injuries. Please let your teacher know if you have injuries so that the teacher can adapt the practice to your needs.</p>
